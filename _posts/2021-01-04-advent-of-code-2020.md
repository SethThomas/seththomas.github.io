The popularity of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) cannot be understated.  In it's fifth year, the 2020 edition of Advent of Code had just over 1.3 _million_ puzzle completions throughout the month of December. ([source](https://adventofcode.com/2020/stats))  

I found [Day 20: Jurassic Jigsaw](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/20) to be *the* most challenging puzzle this year.  While the problem was not difficult to understand, the solution required so many steps that many opted out of the puzzle entirely.  According to AoC [completion statistics](https://adventofcode.com/2020/stats), day 20 was the second _least_ completed puzzle of 2020 (behind the Christmas Day puzzle).

In this blog post, I'll walk you through my solution to this puzzle.  

If you want to jump straight into the code, you can find the entire solution on [github](https://github.com/SethThomas/AOC/tree/master/day20).

## Day 20 - Jurassic Jigsaw

### The Problem

Our input consists of 144 tiles that need to be reassembled to form a single image (like a jigsaw puzzle). Here's an example of two tiles from the sample data

```
Tile 1951:       Tile 2311:
#.##...##.       ..##.#..#.      
#.####...#       ##..#.....       
.....#..##       #...##..#.       
#...######       ####.#...#      
.##.#....#       ##.##.###.       
.###.#####       ##...#.###       
###.##.##.       .#.#.#..##       
.###....#.       ..#....#..       
..#.#..#.#       ###...#.#.      
#...##.#..       ..###..###       
```  

Tiles can be rotated and flipped until one of their sides match.  In the above example, Tile 1951's east edge matches Tile 2311's west edge in their current orientation.

Once the image is reassembled, we are asked to count the frequency of sea monsters in image. This is a sea monster:
```
                  #
#    ##    ##    ###
  #  #  #  #  #  #   
```



### Modeling The Problem

Since I like to solve AoC problems using Object Oriented Ruby, I begin each problem by identifying the key abstractions in the problem domain and modeling them with objects.

A `Tile` class seems like an obvious choice for this problem, so i'll start there. I'll store tile rows as an array of strings in the `@rows` instance variable.

```Ruby
class Tile

  def initialize(id:,rows:)
    @id = id
    @rows = rows
  end

end
```
<br>
I'll also create an `Image` class to represent a set of `Tile` pieces.

```Ruby
class Image

  def initialize(tiles:)
    @tiles = Set.new(tiles)
  end

end
```
<br>
After writing a few lines to code to read in the input file, we're off to the races!
```Ruby
tiles = File.read("input.txt").split("\n\n").map do |data|
  tile = data.split("\n")
  Tile.new(id: tile.first.delete("^0-9"), data: tile[1..-1])
end
image = Image.new(tiles: tiles)
```
<br>
Now, let's move onto to solving the first puzzle of the day.
<br>
### Puzzle 1 - Finding Corner Pieces

The first puzzle asks us to identify the corner pieces and calculate the product of their ID's.

While we _could_ assemble the entire image to identify the corner pieces, there is a simpler solution.  Corner tiles have the unique characteristic of sharing an edge with _exactly_ two other tiles.  Therefore, we can reduce the problem to identifying the four tiles that share exactly two edges with other tiles.

Since we'll be comparing tile edges, I created a method on the `Tile` class that returns the edges of a tile.  Because tiles can be flipped and rotated, the method returns all eight possible edge orientations.
<br>
```Ruby
class Tile
  # other code omitted...

  def all_edges
    @all_edges ||= begin
      # N E S W edges
      edges = [ @rows.first, @rows.map{|r|r[-1]}.join,
                @rows.last , @rows.map{|r|r[0]}.join ]
      Set.new(edges+edges.map(&:reverse))
    end
  end

end
```
<br>
Then, I created helper methods that determine if tiles are neighbors.
<br>
```Ruby

class Tile
  # other code omitted...

  # set intersection of edges
  def shared_edges(tile)
    all_edges & tile.all_edges
  end

  # true if tile is a neighbor, false otherwise
  def neighbor_of?(tile)
    self != tile && !shared_edges(tile).empty?
  end

end
```
<br>
Dropping into an `irb` console, I can confirm this works as expected on a simple `Tile` with two rows.  When in `irb`, I like to represent rows with numbers instead of '*#*' and '*.*' because I think it's easier to visualize.  Since the `Tile` class is storing the rows as strings, I can use whatever representation I'd like.
<br>
```Ruby
➜ irb
3.0.0 :001 > tile1 = Tile.new(id: 1, rows: ["12","34"])
 => #<Tile:0x00007ff3dc82a208 @id=1, @rows=["12", "34"]>
3.0.0 :002 > tile2 = Tile.new(id: 2, rows: ["12","56"])
 => #<Tile:0x00007ff3dc1ed228 @id=2, @rows=["12", "56"]>
3.0.0 :003 > tile1.all_edges
 => #<Set: {"12", "24", "34", "13", "21", "42", "43", "31"}>
3.0.0 :004 > tile2.all_edges
 => #<Set: {"12", "26", "56", "15", "21", "62", "65", "51"}>
3.0.0 :005 > tile1.neighbor_of?(tile2)
 => true
```
<br>
Because _all_edges_ returns all possible edge orientations, I don't need to worry about flipping or rotating the tile when checking for neighbors.  Tiles are neighbors if the the _intersection_ of their edges is not empty.

These `Tile` methods give me a convenient way to identify neighbors for each tile.

```Ruby
class Image

  # other code omitted...

  # return an array of neighboring tiles
  def neighbors_of(tile)
    @tiles.filter_map { |t| t if tile.neighbor_of?(t) }
  end

  # return a hash of tiles to their neighbors (an adjacency list)
  def neighbors
    @neighbors ||= @tiles.map{|tile| [tile, neighbors_of(tile)]}.to_h
  end

  def corners
    neighbors.select{|tile,neighbors| neighbors.length == 2 }.keys
  end

end
```
<br>
I decided to store the results of the neighbor calculations in an [adjacency list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_list), which lets me easily identify corner tiles and calculate the solution to the first puzzle.
<br>

```Ruby
➜ irb
# tiles is an array of Tile objects parsed from a file
3.0.0 :001 > image = Image.new(:tiles=>tiles)
 => #<Image:0x00007ff3dd181db0 @tiles=#<Set:...>>
3.0.0 :002 > image.corners.map(&:id).reduce(:*)
 => 23497974998093
```

### Puzzle 2 - Reassemble The Image

The second puzzle is where things get ~~mind numbingly awful~~ interesting!  

This puzzle requires us to reassemble the tiles into an image, strip the borders from each tile and count the number of times a specific pattern occurs in the combined image.  Oh, and the reassembled image may itself need to be flipped and rotated to find the pattern.

(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻

LETS GET STARTED!

#### Flipping and Rotating Tiles

To make reasoning about this problem easier, I'll assign labels to each of the eight possible tile edges. Starting from the north side of the tile and moving clockwise, I'll use labels A,B,C and D and the reverse of these edges E,F,G and H.

For example, here's the front and back of a 5x5 tile with edges labeled.

![edge labeling](../assets/images/posts/2021/edge_labeling.png#center)

Using these labels, I can represent the front and back side of this tile as A,B,C,D,E,D,G,B.  Note that edges F and H are not represented in this orientation, but _will_ be if we rotate the tile 90 degrees to the right.

![edge label example](../assets/images/posts/2021/edge_labels.png#center)

This newly rotated tile can be represented as H,A,F,C,D,C,B,A

Repeating this process two more times gives me a compact way to represent all possible tile orientations.

This concept translates nicely into Ruby, where I used arrays of [symbols](https://www.rubyguides.com/2018/02/ruby-symbols/) to represent the edges in each tile orientation.


```Ruby
class Tile

  # other code omitted...

  EDGE_LABELS =  %i[a b c d e f g h]
  EDGE_STATES = [%i[a b c d e d g b], # 0°
                 %i[h a f c d c b a], # rotate 90°
                 %i[g h e f c f a h], # rotate 180°
                 %i[b g d e f e h g]] # rotate 270°

  # returns the edge for the given label
  def edge_for(label)
    # hash of label to edge {a: "#..#.",b: ".##..",...}
    @edge_hash ||= EDGE_LABELS.zip(all_edges).to_h
    @edge_hash[label]
  end

end
```
<br>
The `edge_for` method maps the labels to the string representation of the tile edge.  

The `EDGE_STATE` array represents the front and back edges of a tile at each rotation (0°,90°,180°,270°).

Representing tiles in this way means I can avoid complex 2D array transformations while reassembling tiles.  I only need to keep track of how many times the tile has been flipped or rotated.

As a result of how the edge states are modeled, the `flip!` and `rotate!` methods are _dead_ simple.
<br>

```Ruby
class Tile

  SIDES = {:N=>0,:E=>1,:S=>2,:W=>3}
  EDGE_LABELS =  %i[a b c d e f g h]
  EDGE_STATES = [%i[a b c d e d g b], # 0°
                 %i[h a f c d c b a], # 90°
                 %i[g h e f c f a h], # 180°
                 %i[b g d e f e h g]] # 270°

  def initialize(id:,rows:)
    # ...
    @flipped,@num_rotations = false,0
  end

  def rotate!
    @num_rotations = (@num_rotations+1) % NUM_SIDES
  end

  def flip!
    @flipped = !@flipped
  end

  # returns the edge at the specified direction (N S E W),
  def edge_at(direction)
    edge_index = @flipped ? SIDES[direction] + NUM_SIDES : SIDES[direction]
    edge_for(EDGE_STATES[@num_rotations][edge_index])
  end

end
```

<br>
Let's walk through an example of this in action.
<br>

```ruby
➜ irb
3.0.0 :001 > tile = Tile.new(id: 1, rows: ["12","34"])
 => #<Tile:0x00007fe6ac8a6bb0 @id=1, @rows=["12", "34"], @flipped=false, @num_rotations=0>
3.0.0 :002 > tile.edge_at(:N)
 => "12"
3.0.0 :003 > tile.flip!
 => true
3.0.0 :004 > tile.edge_at(:N)
 => "21"
3.0.0 :005 > tile.rotate!
 => 1
3.0.0 :006 > tile.edge_at(:N)
 => "13"
3.0.0 :007 > tile
=> #<Tile:0x00007fe6ac8a6bb0 @id=1, @rows=["12", "34"], @flipped=true, @num_rotations=1>
```  

#### Arranging The Tiles

My solution to the first puzzle left me with an adjacency list, which means I already know the neighbors for each tile.  To reassemble the image, I just need to flip/rotate each tile until it fits with it's neighbors.  Returning to the `Tile` class, I create an `arrange!` method that flips/rotates the tile until the edge is facing the requested direction.

```ruby
class Tile

  # other code omitted...

  def arrange!(dir,edge)
    return false unless has_edge?(edge)
    8.times do |i|
      return true if edge_at(dir) == edge
      i == NUM_SIDES-1 ? flip! : rotate!
    end
  end

end
```
<br>
To reassemble the image, I start by selecting and placing a corner tile in the upper left of the image.  Next, I perform a [breadth first](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) traversal of the adjacency list, rotating/flipping and placing neighboring tiles as I go. This process continues until the traversal is complete.
<br>

```Ruby
class Image

  def initialize(tiles:)
    @tiles = Set.new(tiles)
    @dimension = Math.sqrt(tiles.size)
    @image = Array.new(@dimension){Array.new(@dimension)}
  end

  # other code omitted...

  def reassemble!
    corner = corners.first
    # rotate corner into position
    se1,se2 = neighbors[corner].map{|tile| corner.shared_edges(tile) }
    8.times do |i|
      break if se1.include?(corner.edge_at(:E)) && se2.include?(corner.edge_at(:S))
      i == 3 ? corner.flip! : corner.rotate!
    end
    # place the corner tile
    place_tile(tile:corner,row:0,col:0)
    # process the rest
    assemble_image!(tile: corner, row:0, col:0)
  end

  def assemble_image!(tile:,row:,col:)
    return if row >= @dimension || col >= @dimension
    neighbors[tile].each do |t|
      unless @seen.include?(t)
        if t.has_edge?(tile.edge_at(:E))
          t.arrange!(:W, tile.edge_at(:E))
          place_tile(tile:t, row:row, col:col+1)
          assemble_image!(tile:t, row:row, col:col+1)
        elsif t.has_edge?(tile.edge_at(:S))
          t.arrange!(:N, tile.edge_at(:S))
          place_tile(tile:t, row:row+1, col:col)
          assemble_image!(tile:t, row:row+1, col:col)
        end
      end
    end
  end

  def place_tile(tile:,row:,col:)
    @seen ||= Set.new()
    @seen.add(tile)
    @image[row][col]=tile
  end

end
```

#### Assembling The Image

The last step in reassembling the image requires us to strip the borders from each tile.

```ruby
class Tile

  # other code omitted...

  def remove_borders
    rows.dup[1..-2].map{|row|row.slice!(1..-2)}
  end

end
```
<br>
Before we merge the tiles together, recall that my solution has only involved tile edges. I've never once changed the orientation of the tile rows at any point. Before reassembling the tiles into a larger image, it's time to apply the rotations and flips to *all* rows of the tile. I wrote a method on the Tile class called `refresh`, which returns a copy of the tile rows with the flip/rotate transformations applied.  

```Ruby
class Tile

  # other code omitted ...

  def refresh
    rows = @rows.dup.map{ |row| row.split("") }
    @num_rotations.times { rows = rows.transpose.map(&:reverse) }
    rows.map(&:reverse!) if @flipped
    rows.map(&:join)
  end

end
```
<br>
The Tile class never modifies the tile rows directly.  I found the problem easier to reason about if the tile rows were separate from it's orientation.  This just-in-time tile flipping and rotating prevents my code from unnecessarily transforming 2D arrays at every step of the process.  It also made debugging _much_ simpler.

For good measure, I also added a `rows` method that calls `refresh` on the tile and caches the result for the given flip status and number of orientations.  This ensures that tile transformations are never repeated.

```Ruby
def rows
  @rows_cache ||= Hash.new {|h,k| h[k] = refresh }
  @rows_cache[[@flipped,@num_rotations]]
end
```
<br>
You can see the caching in action in `irb`

```ruby
➜ irb
3.0.0 :001 > tile = Tile.new(id: 1, rows: ["12","34"])
 => #<Tile:0x00007fc734984150 @id=1, @rows=["12", "34"], @flipped=false, @num_rotations=0>
3.0.0 :002 > tile.rows
 => ["12", "34"]
3.0.0 :003 > tile
 => #<Tile:0x00007fc734984150 @id=1, @rows=["12", "34"], @flipped=false, @num_rotations=0, @rows_cache={[false, 0]=>["12", "34"]}>
3.0.0 :004 > tile.rotate!
 => 1
3.0.0 :006 > tile.rows
 => ["31", "42"]
3.0.0 :005 > tile
 => #<Tile:0x00007fc734984150 @id=1, @rows=["12", "34"], @flipped=false, @num_rotations=1, @rows_cache={[false, 0]=>["12", "34"], [false, 1]=>["31", "42"]}>
```


#### Finding Sea Monsters

While this problem could probably be solved with a regex, I opted for a different solution (read: I suck at regexes).  

I converted the sea monster into a set of `(x,y)` coordinates.  Using those coordinates, I traversed my reassembled image checking the collection of points and counting when a match was found.

I put all this logic in a `TileScanner` class because my `Tile` class was starting to feel busy, and this seemed like a separate concern.  The class operates on `Tile` objects; one for the reassembled image and one for the monster.  Because it was smaller, I opted to flip/rotate the monster tile instead of the larger image.

You can check out the implementation [here](https://github.com/SethThomas/AOC/blob/master/day20/tile_scanner.rb) if you're interested in the details.

### Conclusion

We made it!  Phew, that was...a lot.

Day 20 took a _ton_ of effort.  While the problem was simple to understand, the implementation required significantly more code than any other puzzle this year.  This was the only Advent of Code puzzle I did not complete the day it was released.  However, I had _much_ more fun solving the problem after I had a chance to think more deeply about the solution.  

The entire solution, along with unit tests and sample input can be found on [github](https://github.com/SethThomas/AOC/tree/master/day20).
