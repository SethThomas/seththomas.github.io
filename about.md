I am an east coast transplant living in the Pacific Northwest.  I hold B.S. and M.S. degrees in **Computer Science** and have worked as a software developer in the private and public sectors since 2003.  I enjoy building full stack web applications with a penchant for back-end tech.

I am an avid runner, aspiring cyclist and enjoy nearly any outdoor activity.  I live in Oregon with more [senior rescue dogs](https://www.instagram.com/improfessorschnitzel/) than you can shake a stick at.
